# Skills

This repository keeps skills in two places:

- `.windsurf/skills/`: skills actively used by the IDE assistant
- `.claude/skills/`: a mirrored copy for compatibility / portability

If you add a new skill, prefer editing `.windsurf/skills/*/SKILL.md` first, then mirror it into `.claude/skills/` if needed.
